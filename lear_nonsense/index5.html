      There was an Old Man on a hill, <br>
      Who seldom, if ever, stood still;<br>
      He ran up and down<br>
      In his Grandmother's gown,<br>
      Which adorned that Old Man on a hill.
    </div>

    <div class="div-2">
      There was an Old Man in a tree,<br>
      Who was horribly bored by a Bee;<br>
      When they said, "Does it buzz?"<br>
      He replied, "Yes, it does!<br>
      It's a regular brute of a Bee."<br>
    </div>

    <div class="div-3">
      There was an old Person of Cromer,<br>
      Who stood on one leg to read Homer;<br>
      When he found he grew stiff,<br>
      He jumped over the cliff,<br>
      Which concluded that Person of Cromer.

    <div class="div-4">
      The Owl and the Pussy-Cat went to sea <br>
      In a beautiful pea-green boat:<br>
      They took some honey, and plenty of money<br>
      Wrapped up in a five-pound note.<br>
      The Owl looked up to the stars above,<br>
      And sang to a small guitar,<br>
      "O lovely Pussy, O Pussy, my love,<br>
      What a beautiful Pussy you are,<br>
      You are,<br>
      You are!<br>
      What a beautiful Pussy you are!"
    <!-- There was a Young Lady of Russia, <br>
    Who screamed so that no one could hush her;<br>
    Her screams were extreme,<br>
    No one heard such a scream<br>
    As was screamed by that Lady of Russia. -->
