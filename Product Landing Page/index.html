      <h2>A short history of tuning forks</h2>
      <p>
        The invention of the tuning fork is generally credited to the British
        musician, John Shore, in 1711. Strong used his fork as a pitch standard
        to tune musical instruments, a task for which they are still used today.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the 19th century, advances in manufacturing made it possible to
        create extremely precise tuning forks, which were made in sets and used
        as tone generators to identify and measure other sounds. By the last
        decades of the 19th century, tuning forks were among the most precise of
        all scientific instruments. Specialized techniques were developed to use
        them for measuring different kinds of vibrations, and they were
        frequently used as high-precision timing standards. Albert Michelson,
        for example, used light reflected from the vibrating tines of a tuning
        fork to make his historic measurements of the speed of light.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the 20th century, the development of electronic technologies for
        measurement and precision timing quickly replaced technologies that
        employed mechanical tuning forks. One notable exception has been the
        introduction, around 1960, of tiny quartz tuning forks in high-precision
        watches. Maintained in motion by batteries, the resonating forks far
        exceed the accuracy of conventional mechanical watches.

      <h2>Short physics background</h2>
      <p>
        Technically, a tuning fork is an acoustic resonator. When struck it
        produces several tones – a fundamental and at least one harmonic – but
        the fork’s shape tends to minimize the harmonics and within a few
        seconds only the fundamental can be heard. The tone a fork makes is
        determined primarily by the length of its “tines” (or prongs). Longer
        tines vibrate more slowly and thus produce a lower tone. Shortening the
        length of the tines allows them to vibrate faster and thus produce a
        higher sound.

      <h2>Some trivia about tuning forks</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Beats Apparatus</strong><br />
        This instrument was designed to demonstrate the acoustic phenomena of
        “beats”. Beats are produced when two similar sounds interact. If the
        sound’s frequencies differ by only a few wavelengths, their combined
        tone will contain rapid changes in loudness. These are the beats, and
        they are caused by the physical interaction of sound waves as they
        alternately combine creatively, to increase the sound, and
        destructively, to reduce it. Beats provided a convenient way to measure
        sound in the 19th century, because if the frequency of one of the tones
        was known, counting the number of beats per second would allow a person
        to precisely calculate the frequency of the second tone.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Tonometer</strong> <br />
        A “Tonometer” is a carefully constructed set of tuning forks which were
        used, by comparison, to determine the pitch of other sounds. It was the
        German silk manufacturer (and acoustic researcher) Johann Scheibler who
        first suggested this instrument, in 1834, and it was he who built the
        first one. <br />
        Scheibler constructed many tonometers during his life, and different
        sets would have different numbers of tuning forks. His most advanced
        design consisted of 56 forks, which together covered the range of a
        single octave (from A220 to A440) at 4 wavelength intervals.
